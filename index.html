        <h3 class="lb_heading">Dash Parr</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Dash is, as described by his mother as "a very competitive boy, and a
          bit of a showoff". Due to society rejecting Supers, he struggles to
          find a way to vent his energy, not being allowed to partake in sports
          as it could expose their identities and it would be unfair for other
          kids. As a result, he took to using his abilities to throw pranks
          without getting caught to test his limits, causing him to become
          somewhat of a problem child. Dash's reckless nature and one-track mind
          also gets him into trouble with his big sister, Violet. Dash annoys
          her frequently, even using his powers to bully her at times as another
          way to vent his frustration, which has somewhat strained their
          relationship.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          According to official sources, Dash is 10 years old, he stands at 4'0"
          (122 cm) tall, and he weighs 60 pounds (27 kg). He has blonde hair and
          blue eyes, just like his father, Bob. He also has fair skin and light
          freckles. His supersuit consists of a red unitard with black bottoms
          and an "I" insignia on the chest, along with an orange belt, black
          gloves, knee-high black boots, and a black eye mask.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Mr. Incredible</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Bob's personality is that of a classical hero. He is nice, friendly,
          strong, brave, fatherly, heroic and pleasant. But as shown in
          newsreels, Bob is physically invulnerable but all too human in his
          flaws. His NSA file described him as easily distracted and unable to
          prioritize. He grows weary of a world that cannot stay saved for more
          than five minutes; and later, shows a streak of hubris and arrogant
          pride, seeking to relive his glory days at the expense of his family
          life. Bob also has a tendency to try to solve the world's problems on
          his own, refusing and actively dismissing help from anyone, even from
          his loving wife and the sage counsel of his best friend Frozone. These
          flaws combined nearly cost him his life and the lives of his family.
          He loves his wife, even though he doesn't spend much time with his
          family and frequently goes off with Lucius for some crime fighting. He
          also treats other women with respect, which was picked up by Syndrome,
          who instructs Mirage to be appreciative, but not seductive, towards
          Mr. Incredible.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Bob is an exceptionally tall and muscular man with a broad chest,
          shoulders, arms, and legs (as it befits his superhuman strength).
          According to official sources, Bob is currently 6'7" (201 cm) in
          height and he is 350 pounds (159 kg) in weight.
